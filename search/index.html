    "title": "利用Cloudflare Tunnel实现远程桌面访问",
    "body": "2025/08/18 - 如题，本文主要介绍利用Cloudflare Tunnel来实现Windows远程桌面访问。 创建一个Cloudflare tunnel:    登录Cloudflare Zero Trust     左侧导航栏依次进入Networks→Tunnel     创建一个隧道（Create a Tunnel）     选择Cloudflared类型       设置隧道名称（简洁、好记），并保存隧道  之后，网页自动进入配置页面（configure），不要关掉浏览器 配置被访问主机/服务器端: 在隧道配置页面选择远程被访问主机/服务器端的运行系统、处理器架构（以window、64-bit为例）。    在远程被访问主机/服务器端下载安装Cloudflared   两种方法：      在cloudflare/cloudflared Releases页下载msi安装文件    https://github. com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64. msi 直接运行安装      在终端（PS）用winget命理安装：winget install --id Cloudflare. cloudflared      使用管理员方法打开终端（PS或cmd）     运行隧道连接服务，命令见配置网页（包含token，每个账户的都不一样）    该服务随系统启动，后台自动运行。至此，远程被访问主机/服务器端配置完成。 回到第一步最后的浏览器，继续完成配置: 在cloudflare上配置域名过程省略。    点击next，选择连接一个应用（connect an application）     设置子域名（subdomain），选择域名（domain）     选择服务类型RDP，设置URL为localhost:3389     保存主机名后，cloudflare会自动在域名管理中创建一个cname类型的DNS记录（record）。     查看隧道状况。  配置本地电脑/客户端机:    在客户端机下载安装Cloudflared，方法同前     运行RDP监听，命令如下   cloudflared access rdp --hostname rdp. example. com --url rdp://localhost:3389   注：如果3389端口被window自带服务监听，则可以改成其他端口     打开远程桌面连接Remote Desktop Connection应用     计算机输入localhost:3389，开始连接   用户名、密码为远程主机用户名、密码  更新Cloudflared（被访问主机/服务器端、使用过程中）:    与前文相同，两种方法升级Cloudflared      在cloudflare/cloudflared Releases页下载msi最新安装文件    https://github. com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64. msi 直接运行安装更新      在终端（PS）用winget命令更新：winget upgrade --id Cloudflare. cloudflared      重启服务      Services → cloudflared → restart    或者      在终端（PS）用winget命令更新（管理员模式）：net start cloudflared    或      重启系统，自动重启服务。   参考:  Create a tunnel - Cloudflare Zero Trust Connect as a user - Cloudflare Zero Trust Update cloudflared"

    "body": "2025/08/05 - homeassistant migrates image registry from Docker Hub to Github container registry. For example, the image link of supervisor changes from home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0 to ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0. It is very difficult to access ghcr. io directly in China. Therefore, it is impossible to directly update supervisor, etc. This post show a temporary solution. By the way, it works for Homeassistant core as well. Supervisor: homeassistant migrates image registry from Docker Hub to Github container registry. For example, the image link of supervisor changes from home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0 to ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0. It is very difficult to access ghcr. io directly in China. Therefore, it is impossible to directly update supervisor, etc. This post show a temporary solution based on DaoCloud/public-image-mirror. Set up a ready-to-go ghcr image source: Open a sync-image issue. Place the image sorce as a title with the format of &lt;domian&gt;/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;. For example, ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0. Mark the checkbox. And wait one or two minutes. You will received a email with the following content.  镜像 ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0 同步完成请使用 m. daocloud. io/ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0 替代源镜像 Let’s go to pull the image with the new source. Update supervisor from a guest console: Open a guest console via virsh. virsh console hass root Pull the supervisor image from the alternative source. docker pull m. daocloud. io/ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0 Add the recognizable tags. docker tag  m. daocloud. io/ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0   ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0 docker tag  ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:2024. 08. 0   ghcr. io/home-assistant/amd64-hassio-supervisor:latest Stop current hassio_supervisor container. docker stop hassio_supervisor And reboot homeassistant os. hassos-supervisor script will recreate the container automatically. The deprecated images will be removed automatically as well. Note that, you can do this on Terminal addon from homeassistant lovelace. Useful commands: Normal method to update hassio_supervisor. ha su update or ha supervisor update Check jobs running on haos. ha job info List all containers: docker ps -a List images: docker images Core commands: docker pull m. daocloud. io/ghcr. io/home-assistant/qemux86-64-homeassistant:2024. 12. 4 docker tag m. daocloud. io/ghcr. io/home-assistant/qemux86-64-homeassistant:2024. 12. 4 ghcr. io/home-assistant/qemux86-64-homeassistant:2024. 12. 4 ha core update Derect scripts: I place two ready-to-go scripts to make them on Github Gist. And you can run it directly from terminal. Supervisor: curl -l https://gh. api. 99988866. xyz/https://gist. githubusercontent. com/longavailable/40df661bb53da392e5bd136fdc0481f9/raw/77bd64b4efc55029d4ee670f24aca748acf5781f/update-ha-supervisor-amd64-hassio-supervisor. sh | bash Core: curl -l https://gh. api. 99988866. xyz/https://gist. githubusercontent. com/longavailable/44af7d42ac76ac501fe7d7e832519084/raw/9adda982dc74d95ce5dfe2c1faa36829411f72c8/update-ha-core-qemux86-64-homeassistant. sh | bash Both virsh and Terminal addon work.

    "body": "2023/05/26 - If you are using GitHub Actions to automate your workflows, you might want to trigger a workflow based on another workflow’s completion or status. For example, you might want to run some tests after a build workflow finishes, or deploy your application only if the tests pass. In this blog post, I will show you three methods to achieve this functionality. There are different ways to trigger a workflow based on the completion or status of another workflow in GitHub Actions. One method is to use the keyword needs in the same YAML file to specify the dependencies between jobs. Another method is to use the workflow_run event to run a workflow after another workflow has been completed or requested.

    "body": "2022/06/23 - Recently, I am trying to make devices alive in my room. And I found Home Assistant the cool bean. It’s easily to depoly it on a desktop of Windows or Linux. While, I prefer to choose a low-cost server without extra expense. So, I dug out my old android phone (Redmi Pro) from my treasure chest. Let’s see what I can do. A glimpse of Redmi Pro   Released in August 2016,     OS: Android 6. 0, MIUI 10 9. 3. 28,     Rooted.  Terminal emulator   Termux          . . from Google Play: Absolutely NOT!           . . from F-Droid: No. The latest version on F-Droid was released in January 2022. It is for only android &gt;= 7.           . . from Artifacts section of Github Build action workflows (A Github account logged in is necessary). Download termux-app_v***+***-apt-android-5-github-debug_universal and install it on Redmi Pro.          Linux Deploy   It is a potential solution. I tried a few times, but failed to deploy a linux on my Redmi Pro.  So Termux for android 5 was which I chose finally. Home Assistant Operating System, Container, Supervised, and CoreThere is a table to compare these installation methods. https://www. home-assistant. io/installation/#compare-installation-methods Normally, I’d like a most powerful Home assistant. So I tried Operating System, Supervised, Container, and Core, sequentially.    Operating System - Not working!   Failed to install a virtual machine.     Supervised - Not working!   apt, pkg, and … were permanenently locked against running as root.   I can NOT install any package from my root access.   I tried install the dependencies using current user. Failed to isntall udisks2, libglib2. 0-bin, network-manager, and 	dbus.     Container - Not working!   Failed to install docker-compose.     Core - Not working!   Current user again (not root user).   Python 3. 9 or newer is suggested. https://www. home-assistant. io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-core   While, the latest python in the repos supported by Termux is 3. 8 and there is no plan for support or package updates. https://github. com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-on-android-5-or-6   That’s OK. I just ignored them and go on.   Some denpendencies are Not supported. Ignore again.   Finally, pip install homeassistant   And failed at ERROR: Failed building wheel for cryptography. It need a rust &gt;=1. 41, while the latest rust is 1. 38.   Failed again.  All were not working on Termux for android 5. PRoot   proot-distro is NOT supported on android 5/6.  💩   Almost no way to proceed.     ubuntu-in-termux   Lucky. I’ve found a ready-to-use script to install Ubuntu from Termux.   It works like a charm.   So I have a Jellyfish on my Redmi Pro. It will be easily to go on.  Home Assistant Core on ubuntu-in-termux   su user access,     latest python (3. 10),     python3-dev, python3-venv, python3-pip, libffi-dev, libssl-dev, libjpeg-dev, zlib1g-dev, autoconf, build-essential, libopenjp2-7, libtiff5, libturbojpeg0-dev, and tzdata. All dependancies are supported. Perfect!     pip install homeassistant worked as well.     Go with your hass.  Note: Maybe a few bugs. I ignored them. Enjoy Home Assistant on my Redmi Pro! Brainstorm   Not root? Is it possible to work for ubuntu-in-termux?     Refer to the script of ubuntu-in-termux, is it to deply some other Linux distros?  No plan to test.

I solved it as follows: Step1: install Linux GUI Apps on Windows. :  Xming X Server for Windows VcXsrv Windows X ServerStep2: install GTK graphical user interface library (libgtk2. 0-0 or libgtk-3-0) in wsl: sudo apt-get install libgtk2. 0-0 sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 libgtk2. 0-0 is an old version, and libgtk-3-0 is the new version. While both works in the new release of ubuntu. More about GTK GUI library. Step3: set the default display in wsl. : export DISPLAY=:0 Default display number is 0. You can change it in Xlaunch. Of course, you can add it to your . bashrc or . zshrc file. Add followings to it. export DISPLAY= :0  Step4: navigate to your AppImage folder. Dinamica is my case. : cd /mnt/d/dinamicaEGO/v5 Step5: set access mode of AppImage file: chmod a+x Dinamica. AppImage a – all users x – permission to execute the file More about chmod. Step6: extract AppImage. : . /Dinamica. AppImage --appimage-extract Due to windows not support FUSE, AppImage have to be extracted and it will generate a folder named ‘squashfs-root’. Step7: Run it: . /squashfs-root/AppRun Although it works finally, I don’t think it is the way.

Commonly used geographic vector objects include three levels: featureCollection, feature, and geometry. dissolve and union will be compared in the context of geometry. dissolveAggregates some geometris into one geometry.  It works on one object, eg feature or geometryCollection. The latter is a list of geometris and it may be one of multipolygon, multilines, and points.  If two geometris touch, they will be unioned as one geometry.  If two geometris untouch, they will be gathered to one multi-object geometry. Considering the sole input, nothing will change for a geometryCollection.  Due to only one geometry for each feature, it is used to dissolve a multigemotry feature or geometryCollection coverted from multi features.  A similar operation in ArcGIS, Edit -&gt; Select the features to merge -&gt; merge. It may produce a unioned feature or a multigeometry feature.  unary-union in shapely have the same function. unionComputes a geometric union of the input geometris.  It works on at leat two objects.

Create, update and delete a fileYou can do all of them via Contents API.    get_contents in API v3, PyGithub   Python script as follows:   from github import Githubg = Github(). get_user()g. get_repo(repoName). get_contents(filePath)    Here the filePath can be a path for file or directory. For a file, it will has its encoded content with encoding and content keywords. For a directory, it will return a list-like object contents all infomations of the files or subdirectories except content.   Responce examples of GitHub API v3:   The root directory of cscbank: https://api. github. com/repos/longavailable/cscbank/contents.   README. md of cscbank: https://api. github. com/repos/longavailable/cscbank/contents/README. md.   Important❗          It can be used for a directory and a file.           This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the Git Trees API.           This API supports files up to 1 megabyte in size.           type for a directory is dir, and for a file is file.        Suggestion:   If you do NOT want to access content of a file, then donot get_contents for a file. That is, content is the special of this way. In addition, 1MB seems a little small. My idea is using get_contents for a directory to request sha and download_url keywords, then use requests. get(). Git Blobs API is another solution.     create_file in API v3, PyGithub   Python script as follows:   g. get_repo(repoName). create_file(path=file,message= 'update '+file,content= dataBase64)      update_file in API v3, PyGithub   Python script as follows:   g. get_repo(repoName). update_file(path=file,message= 'update '+file,content= dataBase64,sha=sha)    Notice: update_file need sha parameter, you have to request sha before use it.  Git Trees API and Git Blobs API   get a tree in API v3, PyGithub   If a directory has more than 1,000 files or you want to get the content of a over-1MB-while-below-100MB file directly using Git Blobs API.

Actually, treePath/directory likes master:nl/delft works as well.           type for a directory is tree, and for a file is blob.          get a blob in API v3, PyGithub   Notices:          sha is needed to use get_git_blob using PyGithub.

The figure keeps track of all the child Axes, a smattering of ‘special’ artists (titles, figure legends, etc), and the canvas. A figure can have any number of Axes, but to be useful should have at least one. A figure is everything in a final plot. Axes: This is what you think of as ‘a plot’, it is the region of the image with the data space. A given figure can contain many Axes, but a given Axes object can only be in one Figure. The Axes contains two (or three in the case of 3D) Axis objects (be aware of the difference between Axes and Axis) which take care of the data limits (the data limits can also be controlled via set via the set_xlim() and set_ylim() Axes methods). Each Axes has a title (set via set_title()), an x-label (set via set_xlabel()), and a y-label set via set_ylabel()). A axes concludes two (or three) axis, a x-label, a y-label, a title and the space surrounded by them. Axes VS axis: Axes: Axis: These are the number-line-like objects. They take care of setting the graph limits and generating the ticks (the marks on the axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks). The location of the ticks is determined by a Locator object and the ticklabel strings are formatted by a Formatter. The combination of the correct Locator and Formatter gives very fine control over the tick locations and labels. SpinesA axis concludes spines, ticks and ticklabels.

How to set different font when plotting with matplotlib in python?

If it return something like the following:    findfont: Font family ['. . . . . '] not found. Falling back to DejaVu Sans.     Then continue.  Check first: Precautiously check matplotlib font cache or let it go:   cd ~/. cache/matplotlib &amp;&amp; ls    There may have a json file as the matplotlib font cache file. Check if the expected font exists.       If the font exists, this is NOT for you and you can STOP here.    If not, continue.
