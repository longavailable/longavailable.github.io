How to load/embed a page from a html file in Jekyll post. This is the way.

<!--the above is the excerpt-->
<!--more-->
<!--the following is the text-->

# Self-held html file

- Place it into `_includes`.

- Add the following Liquid code to where you want to post contents of the html.

	```
{ % include load_html_test.html % }
	```
	
	**load_html_test.html** is the filename for the test html.

- View the [output](/load_html_test/).

# html held by 3rd-party

This is a tutial - [How TO - Include HTML] from [W3Schools].

- Prepare the HTML you want to include. A html file named **myu_hhu_cn.html** held on [Github] in my case.

- Place the following javascript into your page.

	```javascript
<script>
	function includeHTML() {
		var z, i, elmnt, file, xhttp;
		/*loop through a collection of all HTML elements:*/
		z = document.getElementsByTagName("*");
		for (i = 0; i < z.length; i++) {
			elmnt = z[i];
			/*search for elements with a certain atrribute:*/
			file = elmnt.getAttribute("w3-include-html");
			if (file) {
				/*make an HTTP request using the attribute value as the file name:*/
				xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
				xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
					if (this.readyState == 4) {
						if (this.status == 200) {elmnt.innerHTML = this.responseText;}
						if (this.status == 404) {elmnt.innerHTML = "Page not found.";}
						/*remove the attribute, and call this function once more:*/
						elmnt.removeAttribute("w3-include-html");
						includeHTML();
					}
				}      
				xhttp.open("GET", file, true);
				xhttp.send();
				/*exit the function:*/
				return;
			}
		}
	};
</script>
	```

- Include the HTML by using a `w3-include-html` attribute.

	```html
<div w3-include-html="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longlovemyu/profile/master/myu_hhu_cn.html"></div>
	```
	
- Call javascript function **includeHTML()** at the bottom of the page.

	```html
<script>includeHTML();</script>
	```

- View the [output](/myu_hhu_cn/).
