Experiences of slicing operation `:`, `::`, and `...`.

<!--the above is the excerpt-->

<!--the following is the text-->

# List

```Python
a = list(range(10))
a[:]
a[::]
a[...]
```

`a[:]` is equivalent to `a[::]`. `a[...]` was not working.

# numpy.array

```Python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(10)
a[:]
a[::]
a[...]
```

`a[:]`, `a[::]`, and `a[...]` are equivalent for a numpy.array object. For `s[start:end:step]` operation, the default value of start, end, and step is 0, -1, and 1 separately.
