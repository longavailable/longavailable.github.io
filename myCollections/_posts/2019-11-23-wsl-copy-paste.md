Sometime Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V is a easy way to do things.

<!--the following is the text-->

No mouse operator is the default setting for Ubuntu on Windows 10 WSL. <br>
While copy and paste is the most popular command in Windows. How to enable it? <br>
It depends. It depends on which console / terminal you use. <br>

If you use the default ubuntu console, then check the 'QuikEdit Mode' from properties. <br>

After it, you can pick up what you want by mouse, then copy and paste. <br>

If you use the 3rd party console as [cmder](https://cmder.net/), that will be much easy and flexible.
