Voronoi diagram for polygons is a tool to create a Voronoi diagram also known as Thiessen polygons for polygons. It’s based on Shapely and GeoPandas. There are lots of tools to create a Voronoi diagram for points, for example Create Thiessen Polygons (Analysis) in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop, Voronoi Polygons in QGIS, or voronoi_diagram in Shapely. All of them are really cool. How about a Voronoi diagram for polygons? That’s what this tool does.

[Voronoi diagram for polygons] is a tool to create a [Voronoi diagram] also known as [Thiessen polygons] for **polygons**. It's based on [Shapely] and [GeoPandas]. There are lots of tools to create a [Voronoi diagram] for points, for example [Create Thiessen Polygons (Analysis)] in [ArcGIS Pro] or [ArcGIS Desktop], [Voronoi Polygons] in [QGIS], or [voronoi_diagram] in [Shapely]. All of them are really cool. How about a [Voronoi diagram] for polygons? That's what this tool does.

## Installation, update and uninstallation

### Dependencies

It's based on `voronoi_diagram` from [Shapely] which is new in version 1.8.dev0. As of today, it is still a deveoping version. *(2020-07-26)* You can install or upgrade to the latest version by using:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely
```

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely
```

### To install

Quick installation with [pip]:
```bash
pip install voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```
Or from github:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/longavailable/voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```
Also, you can just copy related functions from "[/longsgis/longsgis.py]" to your work.

### To update

```bash
pip install --upgrade voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```

### To uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```

## Known shortages

- It may produce some polygons (unconnected polygons) around the boundary.
