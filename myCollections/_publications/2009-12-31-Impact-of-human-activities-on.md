To assess dam-induced alterations in the flow regime of the Hanjiang River, this paper selected three hydrological stations above and below the Danjiangkou reservoir, as case study sites, and the whole study period was divided into two subperiods by the year when the reservoir started to store water. On the basis of the 51-year long time series of daily discharge data, the alterations in annual, seasonal, monthly and daily runoff runoff Subject Category: Miscellaneous	 |
