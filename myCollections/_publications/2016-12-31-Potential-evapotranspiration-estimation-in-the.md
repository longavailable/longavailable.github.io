| Abstract       | The atmospheric evaporative demand, one of principal components in water cycle, its accurate estimation is essential for hydrological simulation and forecasting. The purpose of this paper was to propose a plant-growth based dual-source potential evapotranspiration distributed model and investigate its feasibility with the upper Huaihe River basin (China) above the Xixian station as a case study site. Based on the topography, land-use, hydrological, and meteorological data in the Xixian basin, daily gridded potential evapotranspiration was calculated by the newly-build dual-source potential evapotranspiration model during 2000-2010. The relationship between potential evapotranspiration and pan evaporation at different time scales was investigated thereafter. The result revealed that the newly-built model could capture the temporal and spatial variation patterns of potential evapotranspiration moderately well in â€¦	 |
