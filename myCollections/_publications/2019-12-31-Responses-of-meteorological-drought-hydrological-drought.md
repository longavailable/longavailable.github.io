| Abstract       | Spatial scale is a crucial factor in drought propagation and characterization. To investigate the response behavior of the meteorological drought-hydrological drought propagation to different watershed scales, three nested subbasins in the upper Huaihe River basin were selected as case study sites. The Standardized Precipitation Index and the Standardized Streamflow Index were adopted to characterize the meteorological drought and hydrological drought respectively. The relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought was then examined by wavelet coherency analysis and linear/nonlinear regression models. Results showed that (1) linear regression model captured drought propagation best in all subbasins, and the correlation strengthened as the watershed area increased with drought duration being highest correlated among the five drought characteristics;(2) with the watershed area â€¦	 |
