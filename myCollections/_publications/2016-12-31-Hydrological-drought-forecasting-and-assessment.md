| Abstract       | Southwest China is abundant of rainfall and water resources, however, severe and extremely droughts hits it more frequently in recent years, caused huge loss of human lives and financial damages. To investigate the feasibility of the standardized stream index in Southwest China, the Nanpanjiang River basin above the Xiaolongtan hydrological station was selected as the case study site. Based on long-term daily hydrological and meteorological data series, the generated runoff was simulated by the daily Xinanjiang model, then the standardized stream index was calculated and its feasibility was explored by comparing it with other two hydrological drought index. The result revealed that the standardized stream index performed well in detecting the onset, severity and duration in 2009/2010 extremely drought. The output of the paper could provide valuable references for the regional and national drought â€¦	 |
