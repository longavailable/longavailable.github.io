| Abstract       | Due to an intensification of anthropogenic activities and climate change in recent decades, the hydrological connections and relationships between rivers and lakes have been significantly modified globally. Poyang Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes globally and is one of the few that remain naturally connected to the Yangtze River. To investigate the full hydrological conditions (extreme high and low discharge) of Poyang Lake outflow under current bathymetric conditions, a large‐scale 1D‐ and 2D‐coupled high‐resolution hydrodynamic model of the Poyang Lake basin–Yangtze River system was developed. We simulated the outflow and water levels of Poyang Lake under nine different extreme hydrological scenarios with high precision and computational efficiency. We propose (1) a novel partition calibration method to characterize the roughness coefficient of large water bodies in complicated …	 |
