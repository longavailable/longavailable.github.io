| Abstract       | Evapotranspiration, which is an important component of water cycle, is a critical variable in determination of local water resources available. This paper selected the upper Huaihe River as case study site. The daily reference evapotranspiration was computed by the Penman-Monteith method, and then the mean annual reference evapotranspiration (ETref), the decadal average values of annual ETref and the decadal average values of annual seasonal ETref were calculated and mapped. The results revealed that the spatial distribution of mean annual ETref was uneven with a clearly decreasing gradient in the mean annual ETref from the east to the west; The spatial and temporal distribution of decadal average values of annual ETref varied with decades and from 1960s to 1980s , there existed a decreasing trend with an increasing trend from 1980s to 1990s; The spatial and temporal distribution of decadal â€¦	 |
