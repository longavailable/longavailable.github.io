| Abstract       | The flow regime of the Yangtze River (Changjiang) has been altered to some extent by intensified human activities over the past decades, particularly dam construction. To assess the impacts of dam building on the flow regime in the Yangtze River, two of the largest reservoirs on the upper reach, i.e., the Gezhouba and Three Gorges reservoirs, have been selected as case study sites. To analyze the changes in flow regime between predam and postdam periods, the whole study period was divided into three subperiods according to the years when these two reservoirs started to store water. On the basis of the time series of daily flow discharge from four key hydrological stations, i.e., Cuntan, Yichang, Hankou, and Datong, the alterations in annual, seasonal, monthly, and daily flow regimes and water rising or falling regime in different subperiods were investigated and the driving forces were explored. The results â€¦	 |
