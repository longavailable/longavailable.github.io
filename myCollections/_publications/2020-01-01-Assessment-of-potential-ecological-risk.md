| Abstract       | River regulation by the construction of reservoirs represents one of the greatest challenges to the natural hydrological regime and ecological health of riverine systems. The Danjiangkou (DJK) Reservoir is the largest reservoir on the Hangjiang River and started operation in 1967 and was upgraded in 2012 to provide water resource for the South-North water transfer project through central China. However, the effect of the reservoir operation on the downstream hydrological regime and ecological health of the Hanjiang River after the upgrade (increase in dam wall height) has not been examined thus far. The daily discharge series from four stations along the main stem of the Hanjiang River, including a control site were examined from 1950-2017. the study period was divided into three periods based on the different stages of the reservoir operation: i) 1950-1966, ii) 1967-2012 and iii) 2012-2017. The nature of the â€¦	 |
