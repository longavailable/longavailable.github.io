- # [Voronoi diagram for polygons]

	Voronoi diagram for polygons is a tool to create a Voronoi diagram also known as Thiessen polygons for polygons. It's based on Shapely and GeoPandas. There are lots of tools to create a Voronoi diagram for points, for example Create Thiessen Polygons (Analysis) in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop, Voronoi Polygons in QGIS, or voronoi_diagram in Shapely. All of them are really cool. How about a Voronoi diagram for polygons? That's what this tool does.

- # [adaptive-curvefitting]

	Adaptive curvefitting is a tool to find potentially optimal models for your research data. It's based on [scipy], [numpy], and [matplotlib].
